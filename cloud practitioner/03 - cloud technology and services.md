## **1. Compute Services**

AWS offers various compute services to help you deploy, manage, and scale applications. The key is choosing the right compute service based on your workload requirements.

### **1.1 Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
- **What is it?**: EC2 provides resizable virtual servers (instances) in the cloud.
- **Use cases**: Hosting websites, applications, databases, or running batch processing jobs.
  
#### **Key Features**:
- **Instance Types**: EC2 offers different instance types (e.g., compute-optimized, memory-optimized) to meet various use cases.
- **Elasticity**: EC2 allows you to scale up or down by launching or terminating instances as needed.
- **Pricing Models**:
  - **On-Demand**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second.
  - **Reserved Instances**: Commit to one or three years for significant discounts.
  - **Spot Instances**: Purchase unused capacity at a lower cost.

#### **Best Practices**:

- **Use cases**: Persistent storage for applications, databases, and file systems running on EC2 instances.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Persistent Storage**: EBS volumes remain intact when EC2 instances are stopped.
- **Snapshots**: Create snapshots to back up data to Amazon S3.
- **Volume Types**: Choose between General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, or Cold HDD, depending on performance and cost needs.

#### **Best Practices**:
- Use **EBS snapshots** to back up volumes regularly for disaster recovery.
- Select the appropriate **volume type** based on performance requirements (e.g., use **Provisioned IOPS SSD** for high-performance databases).
- Encrypt sensitive data stored in EBS volumes using **EBS encryption**.

### **2.3 Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**
- **What is it?**: EFS provides scalable file storage for use with AWS services and on-premises resources. It automatically grows and shrinks based on usage.
- **Use cases**: Shared file storage for multiple EC2 instances, big data analytics, media workflows.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales up or down based on the volume of data stored.
- **Performance Modes**: Choose between General Purpose and Max I/O performance modes.
- **Integration**: Natively integrates with other AWS services like EC2, Lambda, and RDS.

#### **Best Practices**:
- Use **Amazon EFS** when you need file-level storage that can be shared across multiple instances or environments.
- Configure **lifecycle policies** to move infrequently accessed files to lower-cost storage.
